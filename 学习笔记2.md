# Linear Classification
## Summary:
1. Score function.
2. Loss function.
3. Multiclass support vector machine classifier (SVM).
4. Softmax classifier.

## 1. Score function
Idea: we can find a mapping from image to class(a vector, contains all info about each class), then analyze the class vector.\
Assume N images, K classes, then we nned to define a function f(xi, W, b) = Wxi + b. (xi with all its pixels flattened out to a single column vector).  \
**W: weight**, K * D matrix. \
**b: bias vector**, K * 1 vector. \
**f: score class**, K * 1 vector.(totoal K class, each score for a class) \
Goal: compute scores match the ground truth labels across the whole training data.
